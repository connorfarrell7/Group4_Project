## Segment 1 Goal Summary

Our plan is to build a Machine Learning model to predict whether a person will be selected for an internship based on several factors.

Relevant factors include:

- Age
- Gender
- Field of Study
- Past Internships
- Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
- Dwelling Provided??
- History of Backlogs??

Utilizing these traits from our dataset, we are going to train a classification model - a subcategory of Supervised Machine Learning – to determine the likelihood of acceptance for future applicants.

### Team Communication

***tentative -> possible meeting Wednesday?? No problems if not!
***tentative -> should Friday meetings become a thing?? Also, no pressure!


A dedicated Slack group for members has been formed where we have discussed ideas and meetings via Zoom.
