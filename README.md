## Segment 1 

### Goal Summary

Our plan is to build a Machine Learning model to predict whether a person will be selected for an internship based on several factors. 

### Reason For Selecting This Topic 


### Data Source

The data was sourced from Kaggle from an Engineering Placement dataset ([collegePlace.csv](https://github.com/connorfarrell7/Group4_Project/blob/main/collegePlace.csv)) which features the following relevent factors below.

Relevant factors include:

- Age
- Gender
- Field of Study
- Past Internships
- Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
- Dwelling Provided??
- History of Backlogs??

### Questions We Hope To Answer


### Machine Learning Model

Utilizing these traits from our dataset, we are going to train a classification model - a subcategory of Supervised Machine Learning â€“ to determine the likelihood of acceptance for future applicants.

### Database Integration


### Team Communication

We have decided to have a meeting via Zoom each Friday evening to discuss our progress over the course of the week. We also have a dedicated Slack group for discussions.
